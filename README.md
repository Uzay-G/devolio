# README

Devolio is a social network for developers I built as a hobby in January and March 2020. It taught me a lot about complex Rails  infrastructures, building clean interfaces with Javascript, and how to use Active Storage to allow image uploads.

Features:

- Followers, Posts, Projects, Comments and Likes
- Image uploads through an AWS S3 bucket
- Markdown rendering for the posts
- Search Frontend with Algolia
- Recommendation Algorithm to gather content that will interest users.
- Automated Travis builds for testing

It's really hard to gather a community, but hopefully we can code one together!
